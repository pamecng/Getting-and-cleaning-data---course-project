I. source data

The source data are from the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones 
Data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

Data set Information: 
1. Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors.
2. The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
3. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
4. The following files are available for the train and test data. Their descriptions are equivalent. 
   - 'train/subject_train.txt': Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30. 
   - 'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt': The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128   element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis. 
   - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt': The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration. 
   - 'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt': The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second. 
5. Check the README.txt file for further details about this dataset. 

II. Create a tidy dataset
R script
The run_analysis.R script performs the data cleaning performed in 7 steps:

1. Download zip file

2. Read Data sets
train_sub <- "subject_train.txt""  #Contains train data of 21/30 volunteer subjects being observed
train_values <- "X_train.txt" #Contains recorded features train data
train_activity <- "y_train.txt" #Contains train data of activities’code labels

test_sub <- "subject_test.txt" #Contains test data of 9/30 volunteer test subjects being observed
test_values <- "X_test.txt" #Contains recorded features test data
test_activity <- "y_test.txt" #Contains test data of activities’code labels 

activities <- activity labels


3.Merge Datasets: The training and test sets were merged to create one preliminary data set. 
Use rbind() and cbind function to generate "merged_data"

4.Assign column names

5. Create a tidy data set

5a. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement (i.e. signals containing the strings mean and std)
      

5b.Use descriptive activity names: 
The activity identifiers (originally coded as integers between 1 and 6) were replaced with descriptive activity names
      

5c.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names:
* code column in merged_data renamed into activities
* All Acc in column’s name replaced by Accelerometer
* All Gyro in column’s name replaced by Gyroscope
*  All BodyBody in column’s name replaced by Body
*  All Mag in column’s name replaced by Magnitude
* All start with character f in column’s name replaced by Frequency
* All start with character t in column’s name replaced by Time

6.Create a final independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
FinalData is created by sumarizing merged_data taking the means of each variable for each activity and each subject, after grouped by subject and activity.

7. Export FinalData into FinalTinyData.txt file.
